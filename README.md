# How to run
- Install Bazel

It uses Bazel to compile and build/push image, so it should install it first.
You can reference [**here**](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html) to install it.
Besides it had preset the version of bazel in file of `.bazelversion`, so it should install the one with matched version.

- Compile

Run `./build.sh build` to compile.

```shell

# ./build.sh build

- Create config.yaml

Create a config file in format of yaml. See the [**config.go**](https://github.com/opensourceways/robot-gitee-access/blob/master/config.go) to get details for each configuration items.

```shell

# cat config.yaml

access:
  repo_plugins:
    zengchen1024/repo-test:
    - robot

  plugins:
  - name: robot
    endpoint: http://localhost:8888/gitee-hook
    events:
    - "Merge Request Hook"
    - "Note Hook"

```

- Create HMAC file

```shell

# openssl rand -hex 20 > ./hmac_secret

```

- Run

```shell

# ./robot-gitee-access --port=8000 --plugin-config=./config.yaml --hmac-secret-file=./hmac_secret

```

The command above will start the access in a web service which is listening on port of `8000` and ready to receive the webhook event of Gitee.

- Register a webhook on Gitee

Reference [**here**](https://gitee.com/help/articles/4184) to register the endpoint of `robot-gitee-access` to the Gitee webhook. Please choose the "WebHook Sign" and fill it with the hmac value generated above.
